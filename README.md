# Roadmap for regression problems
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

A roadmap for regressions problems including:
  - feature selection:  xgboost importance and correlation of features
  - preprocesing: conection with S3 (AWS) to get and preprocess data
  - synthetic data generation: Synthetic data generation with VAE's and synthetic minority oversampling techniche (smothe)
  - regressions: linear regressions, decission trees, support vector regressor, XGBoost, NN (with and without PCA or Kernel PCA before the training, customs loss functions and activations), CNN architectures, syntethic 
  - finnetuning: tunner search to find the best architecture on hyper models
